<p style = "color:lightcoral ;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-style: oblique;">I was born in Astana and lived there until 9 years old. Then I moved to the beautiful city of Almaty, I would say that Almaty is my home, which I cannot tell about Astana; because I lived in Almaty for 10 years. Afterwards, I moved back to Astana due to the studies in Nazarbayev University. I love this city even though it is cold and boring. It has beautiful buildings and broad roads, little greens and interesting people. The most important feature of this city for me is HC “Barys”; I am a huge fan of them and every I visit all the games held in Astana. In future, I plan to be a president of the club. </p> <br><br>
